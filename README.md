# Pyramid Descent Puzzle
## Hi AoPS! 

Due to the strong emphasis on team projects in my degree program, I have not completed any individual/publicly accessible coding projects recently. Thus, I have opted to complete the programming puzzle. 

See `solve_pyramid.py` for the most recent solution to this puzzle. 

Please feel free to explore my other public repositories, which are less recent.  

Additionally, I have pinned 2 repositories from `hack4impact-calpoly` to my Overview page. These were both team projects delivered to real non-profits.

## How to run
`python solve_pyramid.py <input_file>`  
or  
`python3 solve_pyramid.py <input_file>`  

### examples:
`python3 solve_pyramid.py pyramid_sample_input.txt`  
`python3 solve_pyramid.py in1`
